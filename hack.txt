# ARM optimizations

Try out following to use assembly optimizations for ARM:
./configure --with-asm=arm --enable-experimental

# Performance dashboard

Add support for monitoring memory usage and other performance, via #11822:

19:06 < sipa> that would be nice to have
19:06 < sipa> heap usage during reindex graphs
19:07 < sipa> as well as performance graphs

Maybe inspired by https://speed.z.cash, uses https://github.com/tobami/codespeed/ ?

Also include IBD speed?

20:08 < jonasschnelli> hkjn0: that would be nice. sdaftuar once mentioned that he has something like a network bypasser...
20:09 < jonasschnelli> Because you want to measure IBD without measuring the network stack

# Better testnet

Discussion to replace current testnet3 with a testnet4 (possibly running both for some time)

Issues with net3 is tons of blocks (1M+), very low difficulty
