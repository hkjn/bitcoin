# autoconf confusion

The confdefs.h and conftest.{cpp,err} files seem to be created during
./configure call (removed afterward?), but it's confusing when those
untracked files show up.. add to .gitignore?

# ARM optimizations

Try out following to use assembly optimizations for ARM:
./configure --with-asm=arm --enable-experimental

# Performance dashboard

Add support for monitoring memory usage and other performance, via #11822:

19:06 < sipa> that would be nice to have
19:06 < sipa> heap usage during reindex graphs
19:07 < sipa> as well as performance graphs

Maybe inspired by https://speed.z.cash, uses https://github.com/tobami/codespeed/ ?

Also include IBD speed?

20:08 < jonasschnelli> hkjn0: that would be nice. sdaftuar once mentioned that he has something like a network bypasser...
20:09 < jonasschnelli> Because you want to measure IBD without measuring the network stack

# Better testnet

Discussion to replace current testnet3 with a testnet4 (possibly running both for some time)

Issues with net3 is tons of blocks (1M+), very low difficulty

# Codewalks

03:45 < valval> is there any form of source code walkthrough?
03:45 < valval> like where i can start off to understand the structure of the codes
03:45 < valval> http://embedded-design-vic.blogspot.sg/2017/07/bitcoin-core-tutorial-and-source-code.html is this a good source?
03:56 < sipa> that looks like a very small random dubset of function
03:57 < sipa> i don't think there is much of a guide, and certainly no up to date one

# License review

Via discussions about possibly including new lib with dual LGPL + GPL licenses, seems like libzmq (optional dependency?) already is included with LGPL:

20:01 < aj> libzmq is lgpl isn't it?
20:01 < wumpus> yes
20:01 < wumpus> aj: no
20:01 < sipa> more in the context of rolling hashes
20:01 < wumpus> aj: oh, you're actually right
20:01 < wumpus> aj: wtf, I never knew
20:01 < wumpus> aj: however zmq is optional
20:02 < BlueMatt> that sucks...our release binaries have lgpl crap in them and we dont have an easy way to get a bitcoind that is linked to everything but zmq?
20:02 < aj> the release binaries have zmq now?
20:02  * BlueMatt wonders if some altcoins are violating that license
20:02 < BlueMatt> almost certainly are
20:03 < achow101> releases have zmq and have had them for a while now
20:05 < wumpus> --disable-zmq

# RPC method naming improvements

In #8170, gettransaction and getrawtransaction RPC methods were split up from gettransaction, but the latter might be better named
getwallettransaction. Comments by laanwj on unsuccessfully proposed change https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11797#issuecomment-350468305
mentions several other misnamed methods, so a possible proposal to rename all methods could introduce new names, gradually deprecate and finally
remove old names several versions later.
